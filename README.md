# CAN-Bus-Data-Analysis-using-Python

Alice drives her Controller Area Network (CAN) enabled car. She has volunteered to make her vehicle’s CAN bus data available to an insurance company XYZ for the purpose of earning the “safe driver” price reduction. Her vehicle data can be used to create position traces and monitor some of vehicular system parameters when moving on these traces.
XYZ obtains the data file called alicedata.json. Now XYZ has to mine this data file to assess the scenario that Alice’s vehicle went through and learn her driving behavior. 

The code.py file processes this data file and derives useful information that helps make decisions on the driver behavior.
